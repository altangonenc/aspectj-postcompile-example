## Setting Up AspectJ Weaving for Project

To ensure successful weaving of aspects within the project, follow these steps:

**1. Build "aspects" Module:**
- Start by obtaining a new Maven build for the "aspects" module.
  - The "aspects" module contains the aspect definitions and needs to be woven before proceeding with other builds.

**2. Build "aspectj-weaving" Project:**
- Next, obtain a new build for the "aspectj-weaving" project.

**3. Execution Precaution:**
- Attempting to run the main program directly without the proper build sequence will result in failure.
- Therefore, it's crucial to first build the project containing Aspect definitions, followed by the other project.
- Afterward, execute the main class to ensure successful weaving.
  - This sequential approach guarantees that the weaving process is successful, as we are performing compile-time weaving.

By adhering to these steps, you'll ensure the effective integration of AspectJ weaving within the project.
